# Promotional-Dashboard

The dashboard display the relationship between the type of promotional campaign held by the company and its sales performance throughout the year 2017. 

Some points that worth for the company to investigate:

1. Should management organise similar campaign that can improve the daily sales during holiday or special festival seasons in the future?

2. Does the campaigns held by the company are too confusing or not actrative to the customers that led to poor sales in these 2 periods?

3. Is customers will keen to start buying for special event like Black Friday (26 November) one week before and after the event?

This dashboard is presented using Tableau.
